# BinarySearchTree-And-Auto-Sort-New-Ran-List
Pretty much what the Name says, made for practice, might use in the future for other projects

To edit within the code
Creates an array, given max size, and it's filled with random numbers, without duplicates, given a max value for the these random numbers
Uses the binary search tree in the code to filter out numbers that are already present in the array 
Then feeds this array into the Binary Search Tree function in order to find the position of a given number
The code has function that takes a random number from an array and feeds that number
